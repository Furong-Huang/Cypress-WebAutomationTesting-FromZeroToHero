# Cypress-WebAutomationTesting-FromZeroToHero
 
Web UI Automation testing framework is developed by Visual Studio Code and Cypress based on one of Angular applications.

Configure the project:

Clone the code by using Git.

Install the Visual Studio Code, NPM and Node.js packages.

Open the project folder by using Visual Studio Code IDE and run below commands in VS code terminal.

Due to not uploading node_modules in github, so Run command to install node_modules firstly : npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular

And then Run command to install the Node.js type definition :  npm install --save-dev @types/node

Finally Run command to compile the project: ng serve
